                <p>I create 3d models and rig them, and I have experience with creating shaders for the models. 
                I also make renders and have experience with making photorealistic and stylized renders of the 
                3d models.</p>

                <p>This is a 3d model of a fictional cellphone that makes an appearance in a game called 
                Splatoon. This project helped me with getting experience on how to do hard surface modeling 
                and making a photorealistic product.</p>

                <p>I have learned how to create models using character sheets as reference. This is one of the 
                models I have made using an official character sheet to test my modeling capabilities.</p>
                <p>I currently use Blender because of its easy access and high capability, but I won't mind 
                having to use a different program such as Maya. I also use Blockbench to make cubic styled 
                models, and I use Gimp and Krita for editing textures, and I have used Photoshop in the past.</p>
