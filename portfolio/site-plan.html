        Introduction
      </h4>
      <p>
        I am Eric Martinez and I'm a 3d artist and programmer. Making 3d art and programming are my passions. Here you will find all my works.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Progamming page link
      </h4>
      <p>
        From a young age programming was the first to catch my attention and become one of my interests. Here is more on what I do as a programmer.
      </p>
      <h4>
        3d animation page link
      </h4>
      <p>
        Later on, I gained an interest in 3d animation which led to me learning how to make 3d models. More on what I do as a 3d artist.

      <h4>

      <h3>Programming</h3>
      <h4>
        What I do
      </h4>
      <p>
        I can program websites, basic programs that can process data, and code addons for a game called Minecraft.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Programming languages
      </h4>
      <p>
        Programming languages that I'm familiar with are JavaScript, Python, HTML, and CSS.
      </p>
      <h4>
        JavaScript example
      </h4>
      <p>
        While in elementary school, I learned a bit of JavaScript and continued learning it in college. Here is an example of JavaScript code I wrote for the Minecraft scripting engine.
      </p>
      <h4>
        HTML example
      </h4>
      <p>
        During my time in college, I learned web development and now I know how to use HTML and CSS effectively. Here's an image of the code of one the projects I worked on while I studied in college.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Minecraft addons (perhaps another link)
      </h4>
      <p>
        I have made and tested various addons for Minecraft. Through persistent research I learned various thing that one can do with an addon. One of the addons I helped make is a port of a mod called Mine Little Pony.
      </p>

      </ul>
      <h3>3d Animation</h3>
      <h4>What I do</h4>
      <p>
        I create 3d models and rig them, and I have experience with creating shaders for the models. I also make renders and have experience with making photorealistic and stylized renders of the 3d models.
      </p>
      <h4>Phone image description</h4>
      <p>
        This is a 3d model of a fictional cellphone that makes an appearance in a game called Splatoon. This project helped me with getting experience on how to do hard surface modeling and making a photorealistic product.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Programs I use
      </h4>
      <p>
        I currently use Blender because of its easy access and high capability, but I won't mind having to use a different program such as Maya. I also use Blockbench to make cubic styled models, and I use Gimp and Krita for editing textures, and I have used Photoshop in the past.
      </p>
      <h4>
        3d model description
      </h4>
      <p>
        I have learned how to create models using character sheets as reference. This is one of the models I have made using an official character sheet to test my modeling capabilities.
      </p>
