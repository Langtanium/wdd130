    <h2>Eric Martinez</h2>
    <p>I like playing video games, making pixel art, making addons for a game called Minecraft, extracting 3d models from games, and I'm learning how to do 3d animation with a program called Blender. I have a YouTube channel where I make papercrafts.</p>
    <p>I'm taking this course because I'm interested in web development and the thought of making my own web page sounds cool. I also have an interest in game development and have an idea to make into a game once I start learing it.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints my entire life, and I know that we have to hold on tight to our beliefs because of the darkness that is rapidly aproching.</p>
